<h1>What is John the Child?</h1>
Picture this, you're almost done with an Object Oriented Programming class, and you want to really put some hard work in to a final project to impress people. You'd seen stuff like CyberChef, Ciphey, and John the Ripper, and you also saw how to use queues for shift ciphers in a textbook once.
<br>
You try and make your own version. Little did you realize that these types of apps/programs have entire teams behind them.
<br>
<i>So you try your hardest to make something that works...</i>
<hr>
<h1> The Technical Details (thus far...)</h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>2+ Ciphers Supported</b> New ciphers yet to come!</li>
    <li><b>Custom Alphabets</b> that you have to type out if you want to use it</li>
    <li><b>Multithreaded Hash Cracking</b> Currently supporting MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256</li>
    <li><b>Programmed exclusively in Java:</b> I'm sorry.</li>
</ul>
