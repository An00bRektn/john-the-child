## What is John the Child?
What was once a child-like attempt to be one-man team behind another cryptography application has become a nice starter for anyone interested in developing a project but doesn't want to work from a blank slate. This was originally created to be a final project for an OOP class, and now serves as an instructional tool for software development.
Pull requests and issues will likely be ignored unless there's good reason not to.
