## John the Child
> A final project for CPSC-24500
<br>
<h1>What is John the Child?</h1>
Picture this, you're almost done with an Object Oriented Programming class, and you want to really put some hard work in to a final project to impress people. You'd seen stuff like CyberChef, Ciphey, and John the Ripper, and you also saw how to use queues for shift ciphers in a textbook once.
<br>
You try and make your own version. Little did you realize that these types of apps/programs have entire teams behind them.
<br>
*So you try your hardest to make something that works...*
<hr>
<h1> The Technical Details (thus far...)</h1>
-  **1+ Ciphers Supported** which is just the Caesar Cipher and ROT-13 (they are definitely totally different things)
-  **Custom Alphabets** that you have to type out if you want to use it
-  **Programmed exclusively in Java:** I'm sorry.

Don't worry, I have plans to make it better. This just looks bad because I approached an Agile schedule with a Waterfall mindset.
